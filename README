*Made and opinionated by https://zay.codes - Reach out if you want to hire us to help build your Flow apps!*

## Overview
"cadence-to-js" helps you make your cadence repositories expose scripts and transactions in a way that is consumable for use within JavaScript and Flow's Client Library (FCL).
Many current examples of using Flow from JavaScript involve writing Cadence within JavaScript files as strings. This is not a great way to write Cadence, as this
separates where you would write your testing for Cadence transactions and scripts from where you actually use them. And the '.cdc' files do not play well with working
with FCL, because the way contracts have variables in FCL is not the same as how Cadence projects use the 'flow.json' to alias contract imports and control deployments.

## Installation
